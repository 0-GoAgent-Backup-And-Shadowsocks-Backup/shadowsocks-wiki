If your question satisfies the following:

1. Has been already answered many times before
2. Provides very little information (OS, env, steps to produce, etc)
3. Looks like your own problem, i.e. lack of Linux knowledge
4. Seems to take a great amount of time to teach you something

Other people may simply ignore your question. Because every day there're HUNDREDS of questions like this, people are getting bored even just to reply hey, please improve your question or we can not answer it!

What should you do?

1. Take a look at [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks/wiki/Troubleshooting)
2. [RTFM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) and [STFW](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/STFW)
3. If it is just a question, post the question to forums or mail lists rather than the issue tracker.
4. Provide [enough information](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. Try to think how can you make it easier and fun for others to answer your question.
